This includes your Form 16 (if applicable), bank statements, investment details, and any other relevant financial records.\n2. **Choose a mode of filing:** You can file your income tax return online through the official Income Tax Department website or through various third-party websites and mobile applications. Alternatively, you can also file it manually by downloading the ITR form from the website and submitting it to the Income Tax Department.\n3. **Register on the portal:** If you're filing your return online for the first time, you'll need to register yourself on the portal. You'll need your PAN (Permanent Account Number) and Aadhaar number to complete this process.\n4. **Login and fill in the details:** Once you've registered, log in to the portal using your credentials. Fill in all the required details, including your personal information, income sources, and deductions. Make sure you enter the correct information, as any discrepancies can lead to penalties or legal action.\n5. **Verify and submit:** After filling in the details, review your return carefully to ensure that everything is accurate. Once you're satisfied, submit your return online. You may be required to pay taxes at this stage if you owe any.\n6. **Acknowledgment:** After submitting your return, you'll receive an acknowledgment number. Keep this safe, as it will help you track the status of your return and any refunds due.\n7. **Upload documents (if required):** If you have any supporting documents to upload, such as Form 16 or bank statements, do so within the specified time frame. Failure to upload these documents may result in delays or rejection of your return.\n8. **Check status:** You can track the status of your income tax return online using the acknowledgment number. This will help you keep track of any updates and ensure that your return has been processed correctly.\n9. **File a revised return (if necessary):** If you discover any errors or omissions in your original return, you may need to file a revised return. Make sure you do this within the specified time frame to avoid penalties.\n10. **Pay taxes:** If you owe any taxes, make sure you pay them on time to avoid penalties and interest charges. You can pay online through various modes, including net banking, credit/debit card, or NEFT.\n\nRemember that the income tax rules and regulations are subject to change every year, so it's a good idea to stay updated with any new developments. If you're unsure about any aspect of filing your return, consider consulting a professional tax consultant or accountant for guidance.

However, I can suggest some legal ways to reduce your tax burden:\n\n1. Contribute to a retirement account: Many countries offer tax incentives for individuals who contribute to retirement accounts such as 401(k)s or IRAs. These contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, which reduces your taxable income.\n2. Take advantage of deductions and credits: The government offers various deductions and credits that can help reduce your tax liability. Examples include deductions for mortgage interest, property taxes, and charitable donations. Be sure to keep track of all eligible expenses throughout the year.\n3. Invest in tax-exempt bonds: Municipal bonds are often exempt from federal income tax and sometimes state income tax as well. This can be a great way to earn passive income while reducing your taxable income.\n4. Consider tax-loss harvesting: If you have investments that have lost value, you may be able to sell them at a loss and use the capital losses to offset gains from other investments. This can help reduce your overall tax liability.\n5. Work with a tax professional: A qualified tax professional can help you identify legal ways to minimize your tax burden and ensure that you are taking advantage of all available deductions and credits.\n\nRemember, it's always important to follow the law when it comes to taxes.

It contains a comprehensive list of offenses and their respective punishments, covering various aspects of criminal behavior such as murder, theft, robbery, rape, and more. The IPC has been amended several times since its inception to address changing societal needs and legal requirements.\n\nThe IPC is divided into 23 chapters, with each chapter focusing on a specific area of crime. Some of the key chapters include:\n\n1. Of Homicide (Chapter II) - This chapter deals with offenses related to causing death, such as murder, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and abetment of suicide.\n2. Of Culpable Homicide (Chapter III) - This chapter covers various aspects of culpable homicide, including the different degrees of punishment for causing death due to negligence or rashness.\n3. Of Robbery and Dacoity (Chapter IV) - This chapter deals with offenses related to theft, robbery, and dacoity, including the use of force or violence during the commission of these crimes.\n4. Of Criminal Intimidation, Insult, and Annoyance (Chapter VI) - This chapter covers offenses related to causing fear or annoyance to others, such as criminal intimidation, insult, and defamation.\n5. Of Offences Against Public Justice (Chapter VII) - This chapter deals with offenses that undermine the administration of justice, such as perjury, subornation of perjury, and contempt of court.\n6. Of Offences Relating to Property (Chapter VIII) - This chapter covers various property-related crimes, including theft, robbery, and criminal breach of trust.\n7. Of Offences Against the Person (Chapter IX) - This chapter deals with offenses that cause harm or injury to a person's body, such as assault, grievous hurt, and rape.\n8. Of Offences Relating to Marriage (Chapter X) - This chapter covers various crimes related to marriage, including bigamy, adultery, and cruelty by husband or wife.\n9. Of Offences Relating to Religion (Chapter XI) - This chapter deals with offenses that involve religious sentiments, such as blasphemy, sacrilege, and insulting religious beliefs.\n10. Of Offences Relating to Public Servants (Chapter XII) - This chapter covers various crimes committed by public servants, including abuse of authority, misconduct in office, and corruption.\n\nThe IPC is a crucial piece of legislation in India, providing the legal framework for addressing criminal behavior and ensuring justice for victims. It has been widely adopted and adapted by other countries in South Asia and beyond, making it one of the most influential criminal codes in the world.

It was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950.\n\nThe Constitution of India is a lengthy document consisting of 395 articles divided into 22 parts, 12 schedules, and 5 appendices. It covers various aspects of governance, including the structure of the government, fundamental rights, directive principles of state policy, and the relationship between the central and state governments.\n\nSome key features of the Constitution of India include:\n\n1. Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic: These are the four pillars on which the Indian Constitution is based.\n2. Federal System: The Constitution provides for a federal system of government with a strong center and weak states.\n3. Fundamental Rights: The Constitution guarantees six fundamental rights to all citizens, including the right to equality, freedom of speech and expression, and the right to life and personal liberty.\n4. Directive Principles of State Policy: These are non-justiciable principles that provide guidelines for the state to follow in framing laws and policies.\n5. Judicial Review: The Constitution provides for judicial review, which allows the courts to strike down any law or action by the government if it is found to be unconstitutional.\n6. Emergency Provisions: The Constitution includes provisions for emergencies, such as the President's Rule and the National Emergency, which allow the central government to take over the administration of a state or impose restrictions on fundamental rights during times of crisis.\n7. Amendment Process: The Constitution provides for an amendment process that allows for changes to be made to the Constitution through a parliamentary majority and ratification by at least half of the states' legislatures.\n\nOverall, the Constitution of India is a complex document that has played a crucial role in shaping the country's political, social, and economic landscape since its adoption in 1949. It continues to be a living document that evolves with the changing needs and aspirations of the Indian people.","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"\nllama_print_timings:        load time =     584.97 ms\nllama_print_timings:      sample time =     251.15 ms /   483 runs   (    0.52 ms per token,  1923.15 tokens per second)\nllama_print_timings: prompt eval time =     234.86 ms /    15 tokens (   15.66 ms per token,    63.87 tokens per second)\nllama_print_timings:        eval time =   22803.93 ms /   482 runs   (   47.31 ms per token,    21.14 tokens per second)\nllama_print_timings:       total time =   25719.23 ms\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from llama_cpp import Llama\n\nmy_model_path = './upshot-sih-7b-v2.0.gguf'\ncontext_size = 4000\n\n#load the model\nupshot_model = Llama(model_path = my_model_path,\n                    n_ctx = context_size,\n                    n_gpu_layers = 40)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-12-17T00:55:00.863934Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-12-17T00:55:00.864826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-12-17T00:55:06.730510Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-12-17T00:55:00.864789Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-12-17T00:55:06.729575Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"ggml_init_cublas: GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ:   no\nggml_init_cublas: CUDA_USE_TENSOR_CORES: yes\nggml_init_cublas: found 2 CUDA devices:\n  Device 0: Tesla T4, compute capability 7.5\n  Device 1: Tesla T4, compute capability 7.5\nllama_model_loader: loaded meta data with 21 key-value pairs and 291 tensors from ./upshot-sih-7b-v2.0.gguf (version GGUF V3 (latest))\nllama_model_loader: -

interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it popular among beginners and experienced developers alike.\\n\\nPython has a wide range of applications, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific computing, and more. The language is open source, meaning that it is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute.\\n\\nSome key features of Python include:\\n\\n1. Easy-to-read syntax: Python's code is designed to be easy to read and understand, even for those who are new to programming. This makes it a great language for beginners to learn.\\n2. Interpreted execution: Unlike compiled languages like C++ or Java, Python is an interpreted language. This means that the code is executed line by line as it is written, rather than being compiled into machine code before running. This can make development and debugging faster and more efficient.\\n3. Object-oriented programming (OOP): Python supports OOP, which allows developers to create reusable code modules called classes. This makes it easier to organize and maintain complex projects.\\n4. Extensive standard library: Python comes with a large collection of built-in libraries that provide functionality for tasks such as string manipulation, file I/O, networking, and more. This can save developers time by allowing them to use pre-existing code instead of writing everything from scratch.\\n5. Cross-platform compatibility: Python is designed to be portable across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and others. This makes it easy for developers to write code that can run on multiple platforms without needing to make significant changes.\\n6. Strong community support: Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, create new libraries and tools, and provide support through forums, mailing lists, and online tutorials. This makes it easier for developers to find help when they need it.\\n7. Integration with other languages: Python can be used in conjunction with other programming languages, such as C++ or Java, allowing developers to leverage the strengths of different languages for specific tasks.\\n8. Dynamic typing: Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables are assigned types at runtime rather than being declared explicitly. This can make development faster and more flexible, but it also requires careful attention to avoid potential issues with variable assignments.\\n9. GIL (Global Interpreter Lock): Python has a Global Interpreter Lock, which ensures that only one thread can execute at a time in a single process. This can impact the performance of multi-threaded applications, but it helps prevent certain types of race conditions and other concurrency issues.\\n10.
